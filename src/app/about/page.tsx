      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>AgriFood</strong> is a blockchain-powered platform designed to
        bring transparency, traceability, and trust to the agricultural food
        supply chain. From farm to fork, we aim to ensure every step of the
        journey is secure, verifiable, and efficient.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-secondary">🌱 Our Vision</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To revolutionize the agri-food industry with technology that empowers
        farmers, manufacturers, transporters, suppliers, and consumers alike.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-secondary">🔗 Powered by Blockchain</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We leverage blockchain to record all transactions related to food production
        and distribution. This ensures data immutability, secure access rights,
        and real-time verification of product provenance.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-secondary">🚚 Trusted Supply Chain</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Each stakeholder — farmer, manufacturer, supplier, transporter — has a verified
        digital identity. Our smart contracts automate and secure the exchange of
        goods and information across the supply chain.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-secondary">🤝 Join the Movement</h2>
